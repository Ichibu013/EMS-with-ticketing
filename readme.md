   
## Project Dependencies

Our Flask event management system will utilize the following key libraries:

-   **Flask**: The core web framework for building our application.
    
-   **Flask-SQLAlchemy**: Provides Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) integration, simplifying database interactions.
    
-   **Flask-Migrate**: Essential for managing database schema changes and migrations.
    
-   **Flask-WTF**: Facilitates robust form handling and includes built-in Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection.
    
-   **Flask-Login**: Manages user sessions, handling login, logout, and user authentication.
    
-   **Werkzeug[bcrypt]**: Used for secure password hashing. `bcrypt` is installed as a dependency of Werkzeug's password utilities.
    
-   **Python-dotenv**: Enables convenient loading of environment variables for configuration.
    

## Initial Project Structure

The project will be organized as follows:

```
