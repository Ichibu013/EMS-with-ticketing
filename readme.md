Here are the initial setup instructions for your Flask event management system:

## 1. Create Project Directory & Virtual Environment

First, you'll need to create the main project folder and set up a virtual environment to manage your project's dependencies in isolation.

**Create Folder:**

```
mkdir event_management_system
cd event_management_system

```

**Create Virtual Environment:**

```
python -m venv venv

```

**Activate Virtual Environment:**

-   **Windows:**
    
    ```
    venv\Scripts\activate
    
    ```
    
-   **macOS/Linux:**
    
    ```
    source venv/bin/activate
    
    ```
    

## 2. Install Core Dependencies

Once your virtual environment is activated, install the necessary Python packages using pip. The command provided was incomplete, so here is the full command including `python-dotenv`:

```
pip install Flask Flask-SQLAlchemy Flask-Migrate Flask-WTF Flask-Login Werkzeug[bcrypt] python-dotenv

```

This command will install all the libraries listed in your project dependencies.

## 3. Project Dependencies

Our Flask event management system will utilize the following key libraries:

-   **Flask**: The core web framework for building our application.
    
-   **Flask-SQLAlchemy**: Provides Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) integration, simplifying database interactions.
    
-   **Flask-Migrate**: Essential for managing database schema changes and migrations.
    
-   **Flask-WTF**: Facilitates robust form handling and includes built-in Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection.
    
-   **Flask-Login**: Manages user sessions, handling login, logout, and user authentication.
    
-   **Werkzeug[bcrypt]**: Used for secure password hashing. `bcrypt` is installed as a dependency of Werkzeug's password utilities.
    
-   **Python-dotenv**: Enables convenient loading of environment variables for configuration.
    

## 4. Initial Project Structure

The project will be organized as follows:

```
event_management_system/
├── venv/                       # Python virtual environment
├── .env                        # Environment variables (e.g., secret keys, database URLs)
├── requirements.txt            # Lists all project dependencies
├── run.py                      # Script to run the Flask application
└── app/                        # Main application package
    ├── __init__.py             # Application creation, configuration, and blueprint registration
    ├── config.py               # Centralized configuration settings for the application
    ├── models.py               # Defines database models (e.g., User, Event) using SQLAlchemy
    ├── forms.py                # Contains WTForms definitions for various forms (e.g., login, registration)
    ├── routes.py               # Defines URL routes and their corresponding view functions (will be split into blueprints later)
    ├── templates/              # Stores Jinja2 HTML templates
    │   ├── base.html           # Base template for consistent page structure
    │   └── home.html           # Example home page template
    └── static/                 # Holds static assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images
        ├── css/                # Stylesheets for the application's look and feel
        └── js/                 # JavaScript files for interactive elements

```




## 5. Database Migrations (CLI)

After setting up your project and installing dependencies, you'll use Flask-Migrate to manage your database schema. This involves initializing the migration repository, creating migration scripts, and applying them to your database.

Here are the steps for setting up and managing database migrations for your Flask application:

**Initialize Migrations:**

This command sets up the migration environment by creating a `migrations` folder in your project directory. You only need to run this once.

```
flask db init

```

**Create First Migration (User, Event, Ticket models):**

After defining your database models (e.g., `User`, `Event`, `Ticket`) in `app/models.py`, run this command to generate the first migration script. This script will contain the necessary changes to create your database tables based on your models. The message in quotes is a descriptive note for the migration.

```
flask db migrate -m "Initial migration for User, Event, Ticket models"

```

**Apply Migrations:**

Finally, execute this command to apply the pending migrations to your database. This will create the `site.db` SQLite file (if you're using SQLite) or connect to and update your configured PostgreSQL database.

```
flask db upgrade

```
